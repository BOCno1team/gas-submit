# 2019 CallForCode-GAS TEAM FROM BANK OF CHINA
Our system consists of three parts, each part is an independent project.   
Because only one GitHub link is allowed while submitting, we put them into different folders.   
Here comes a simple introduction towards these three parts:   
1.GAS: project of matching algorithm;   
2.chaincode: project of smart contract;   
3.goodspages: project of web front-end.   
For better understanding, a reference folder also is offered.
